Certainly! Here's a structured overview of the Global Threat Management (GTM) Project based on the agenda you've provided:

GTM (Global Threat Management) Project Overview
The Global Threat Management (GTM) project is a strategic cybersecurity initiative focused on enhancing the organization’s capability to proactively identify, assess, and respond to emerging and existing cyber threats on a global scale. It aligns with enterprise risk management and regulatory compliance goals to secure critical assets, maintain business continuity, and build cyber resilience.

Objectives:

Centralize and coordinate global threat intelligence.

Improve detection and response capabilities.

Implement standardized frameworks for threat identification and mitigation.

Integrate threat intelligence with incident response and risk management processes.

Key Benefits:

Faster response times to cyber threats.

Improved situational awareness across global operations.

Reduced risk of data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.

Workstreams
The GTM project typically consists of multiple coordinated workstreams, each responsible for a specific aspect of threat management. Below are common examples:

Threat Intelligence Integration

Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating threat data from internal and external sources.

Security Operations Center (SOC) Enhancement

Upgrading or centralizing SOC capabilities, playbooks, and automation.

Threat Detection and Response

Implementing SIEM, XDR, SOAR solutions to improve detection and incident response time.

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Alignment

Ensuring threat management strategies align with regulatory requirements and internal policies.

Red/Blue/Purple Team Exercises

Simulating real-world attacks to test detection and response capabilities.

Tooling and Platform Modernization

Migrating to or integrating new platforms and technologies for threat visibility and reporting.

Ways of Working
To ensure seamless collaboration and delivery across teams and geographies, the project employs the following working principles:

Agile Methodology

Iterative sprints for rapid delivery and continuous improvement.

Cross-Functional Teams

Involving security analysts, engineers, threat hunters, compliance officers, and business stakeholders.

Regular Governance and Reporting

Weekly/bi-weekly standups, steering committee updates, and milestone tracking.

Knowledge Sharing

Creating centralized documentation, playbooks, and best practices for global teams.

Tool-Driven Collaboration

Leveraging platforms like Jira, Confluence, MS Teams/Slack, and threat intelligence platforms for communication and tracking.

Next Steps
Here’s a typical sequence of upcoming activities in the GTM project lifecycle:

Finalize Project Charter

Define scope, timelines, KPIs, and responsibilities.

Stakeholder Alignment

Host workshops with global teams and leadership to refine requirements and ensure buy-in.

Workstream Kick-off

Launch individual workstreams with assigned leads and sprint goals.

Baseline Assessments

Conduct gap analyses of current threat management maturity, tools, and processes.

Tooling and Platform Decisions

Select or refine existing technologies (e.g., threat intel platforms, SIEMs).

Implementation Phase

Begin deployments, configurations, and testing of threat management solutions.

Training and Enablement

Equip teams with the knowledge and processes to operate new tools and frameworks.

Continuous Monitoring and Optimization

Measure performance, gather feedback, and iterate to improve.
